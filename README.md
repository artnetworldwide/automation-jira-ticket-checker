# jira-ticket-checker

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that enforces the linkage of a Jira ticket to a pull request before it can be merged

## Installation
After installing the app, create a `.github/config.yml` file in the default branch of either:

1. The repository you want the configuration to be applied in or
2. A repository with the name `.github` to apply the configuration to all repositories

Repositories can belong to either a user account or organization.

Example:

```yaml
jiraBaseUrl: https://www.foobar.com/Jira
```
